# Building a Generalizable Machine Learning Model to Predict Airbnb
Price Across U.S. Cities

This project attempts to build a generalizable
price prediction tool for Airbnb rental units.
Specifically, the objective was to see if it is
possible to train a model on the data from one
city (New York City) and then use that model
to predict listing prices in a different city (San
Francisco). Although we were able to generate
good results using same-city data, the models
had a difficult time generalizing across the two
cities.
